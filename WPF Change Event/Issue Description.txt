
VSTO Add-in: Workbook.SheetChange event handler stops working after WPF Window is Activated for a second time, or GotFocus.


I have a VSTO Excel add-in, where I want to capture changes in the worksheet using the Workbook.SheetChange event handler.
My Add-in opens WPF windows via Ribbon buttons to interact with the user and perform functions on the worksheet. I find that after opening the WPF window, my SheetChange event handler no longer fires.

I have created a simple test add-in to evaluate the different use-cases and have narrowed down the issue to something to do with the WPF window. 
Specifically, when the window is Activated a second time, or when the GotFocus event gets triggered.

The issue also occurs whether the new window (WPF or Form) is run from the Main thread or from a background thread ( STA vs MT )

When I run the same tests against a Windows Form window, the issue does not present itself and the SheetChange event fires correctly.


The test add-in is described below.



Working use-case

	1. Start with a blank workbook
	2. Click 'Set Book Handle', Click OK on the MessageBox
	3. Change the value of a cell in the sheet
	4. You should see cell A1 update with Event: 1, The counter is to keep record of how many times the event fired
	5. Now Click 'Show STA Form'
	6. Test A - Will update 5 cells on the sheet, so the counter should increase by 5
	7. Text B - Will update a single cell, the counter should increase by 1 each time it is clicked
	8. Close the Form, change another cell value in the sheet, the counter should increase by 1
	9. Repeat the test, but click 'Show MT Form'
	10. You should notice that the SheetChange event is fired consistently each time a cell is updated.


Failed use-case

	1. Start with a blank workbook
	2. Click 'Set Book Handle', Click OK on the MessageBox
	3. Change the value of a cell in the sheet
	4. You should see cell A1 update with Event: 1, The counter is to keep record of how many times the event fired
	5. Now Click 'Show STA WPF Window'
	6. When the window loads, ACTIVATED shows 0
		a. Note: If the window is moved at this point, the event does not fire, even without clicking any buttons.
		b. Note: The test also fails if the user click in the window ( blank area between two buttons for example)
	7. Click Test A - This will update 5 cells on the sheet, so the counter should increase by 5. Which is the case.
	8. Click Test B - This will update a single cell, the counter should increase by 1 each time it is clicked. This does not occur! Notice the status now shows FOCUS 0
	9. After this point, the SheetChange event no longer fires
	10. This test can be repeated with the 'Show STA WPF Dialog' and 'Show MT WPF Window'


Interesting Discovery
	1. Once the SheetChange event no longer fires after running the above tests, if I re-register the SheetChange event by clicking Set Book Handle again. The above tests now pass and I am not able to re-produce the original issue using the WPF Windows.
	2. The 'Work Around' button attempts to 'break' the event then re-register it, in an attempt to work around the issue.
